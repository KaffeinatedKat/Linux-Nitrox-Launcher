# Linux-Nitrox-Launcher
A bash script that allows the Windows version of the Subnautica Nitrox Launcher to work via Proton as it takes a few extra steps to load the mod properly

# How to run
Download Proton 6.3

Download Subnautica to the default steam library path and run it once

Download the [Nitrox Mod](https://nitrox.rux.gg/) and extract it

Download and put Nitrox.sh into the same folder you extracted Nitrox to

Run Nitrox.sh

**If the Nitrox Launcher results in any errors open an issue here, as the people in the Nitrox Discord probally can't help you as you are running it via Proton and not Windows**
